# 🔗 LinkedIn Lead Generation via Google API (n8n Workflow)

This project is an automated workflow built using [n8n](https://n8n.io/) to extract LinkedIn profile links for lead generation using the **Google Custom Search API**.  
Instead of scraping LinkedIn directly (which violates their terms), this workflow uses Google Search to find publicly available LinkedIn profile pages.

## 🚀 What This Workflow Does

This **n8n workflow** performs the following automated steps:

1. Accepts a search keyword (e.g., `Marketing Manager at Microsoft`)
2. Sends a request to Google Custom Search API to get search results
3. Extracts public LinkedIn profile URLs from the search response
4. Appends those URLs and relevant data to a **Google Sheet**
5. Supports pagination to loop through multiple result pages automatically

## 🧩 Components Used in the Workflow

Below is a detailed explanation of each component used in the n8n flow:

| Component                          | Purpose |
|-----------------------------------|---------|
| **🔘 Trigger: `Execute Workflow`** | Starts the workflow manually by clicking a button inside n8n. Useful for on-demand lead scraping. |
| **✏️ Set Fields (Manual Input)**   | Allows you to manually set search parameters like job title, company, or location. |
| **🌐 HTTP Request**                | Sends a **GET request** to Google Custom Search API using your search parameters to get public LinkedIn profiles. |
| **🧩 Extract Results**             | Parses the JSON response to extract relevant fields such as profile links and descriptions. |
| **⏸ Wait**                        | Optional delay to prevent hitting API rate limits (can be customized). |
| **📄 Append Row in Sheet**        | Appends parsed results to your connected Google Sheet. |
| **🔍 Pagination Check**           | Detects if additional pages of results are available via `nextPageToken`. |
| **➡️ IF Condition**               | If more pages are found, the workflow loops back to continue fetching. Otherwise, it stops. |
